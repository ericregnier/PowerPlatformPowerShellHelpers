# Power Platform PowerShell Helpers
Some lightweight PowerShell helper scripts for Power Platform / Common Data Service (CDS) / Dynamics 365 (D365).

These helpers allows you to script different CDS operations and deployment activities that cannot be performed with a solution import, particularly with unmanaged solutions. For example deleting components such as fields, views, etc.

Available functions:
- Delete processes (classic workflows and business rules)
- Delete entities
- Delete fields
- Delete forms (views, web resources, forms, dashboard, workflow, plugin step, field security profile)
- Delete views
- Delete option sets
- Delete option set items
- Delete plugin steps
- Delete web resources
- Delete solutions
- Update Service Endpoints (Queues and Webhooks)
